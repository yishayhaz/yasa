  ? So, what's going on here?

  * our application has 3 breakpoints (only):
  - mobile: 0 - 767px
  - tablet: 768px - 1199px
  - desktop: 1200px and up

  * we have 5 mixins:
  - mobile: for mobile only (0 - 767px)
  - tablet-and-mobile: for tablet and mobile (0 - 1199px)
  - tablet: for tablet and mobile (0 - 1199px)
  - tablet-and-desktop: for tablet and desktop (768px and up)
  - desktop: for desktop only (1200px and up)

  Note: this file should be in sync with the useDevice hook at src/providers/device/index.js
